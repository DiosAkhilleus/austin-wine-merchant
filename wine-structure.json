    "description": "The 2016 Canalicchio di Sopra Brunello di Montalcino is flat-out stunning, remarkably vibrant and an almost-ethereal expression. There’s an exotic citrusy tinge to its ripe black cherries, taking on hints of sage, cedar and allspice, all grounded by moist earth tones. It’s focused and remarkably pure with a noticeable inner sweetness to the red and hints of blackberry fruit, all cast across a silky, feminine frame. The structure builds like a crescendo, as minerals fade to youthful tannins. Juicy acids maintain perfect balance from start to finish, making for a surprisingly fresh expression yet with amazing length. There’s simply so much going on here, and there are promises of more good things to come. Drink 2024‑2038. Rated 95. - Eric Guido, vinous.com November, 2020",
